_CST1340, COURSEWORK, SPRING 2025_

## 1 What do you have to submit  

This coursework requires two files submitted to the coursework submission link on My Learning: 
1. A report document from your group. 
2. A ZIP archive of all your HTML and XML files.

These files must be submitted by the deadline: 
    ### Week 12, Friday, 23:59 April 11, 2025 

You can use a template to create your report (provided on My Learning). Your report must specify the contribution of each group member. In addition, each group will be expected to demonstrate their website during the lab sessions in Week 12. All group members MUST be present. 

## 2 What do you need to do 

This coursework should be completed in groups of a maximum of 4 (four) students. Find yourself a group and make sure you find a time and place to meet and discuss/complete work every week. 
The overall aim of this coursework is to design and develop a 2-page website for a bookshop (or a music record shop if you prefer). The main objectives are:
- Create an HTML page for the website 
- Demonstrate knowledge of CSS via implementation 
- Create an XML page 
- Demonstrate knowledge of DTD via implementation 
- Design a website that renders data from the XML file (transformation) 

You should use a text editor to create the website (i.e., Notepad, Emacs, VI, etc). Do not use dedicated Web design tools or environments for this coursework.
-  The website must contain 2 pages: a main page and a program page. 
-  The main page should be an HTML file. It should contain general information about the bookshop, such as the address, the contact details, and the opening times of the bookshop.
-  The main page should contain at least one paragraph, one list and one table. For example, you can include a brief introduction of the bookshop in a paragraph, include the main genres in a list and the opening times in a table.
-  Feel free to apply different formatting and styling to improve the presentation of the web page (TIP: consider using CSS).
-  The program page should be an XML file. The XML file should store information about the books sold following an XML data schema (TIP: consider using DTD).
-  Ideally, when the page is opened, the book list should be displayed in a table format (TIP: consider using XSL).
-  Both the main page and the program page should contain a link to each other (TIP: consider using the <a> tag).

## Project Instructions

This website will consist of 4-6 pages (exact number TBD), including:
- Home
- Store
- Preview
- Checkout
  - A cart feature will be integrated into each page, rather than having a separate cart page.

Since we are only using HTML, CSS, and XML/XSL, full functionality is not required. Below, you'll find the coursework requirements for easy reference while working on the project.

### Section 1: HTML
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshots of the first page of your website.
- Annotated screenshots of the HTML code used.
- Annotated screenshots of the CSS code used.

### Section 2: XML
This section should include:
- The XML schema, with an explanation.
- Annotated screenshot of the XML file.
  - The XML file should contain descriptive tag names, attributes, and appropriate content.

### Section 3: Validation
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshot of the DTD file that validates the XML created in Section 2.
  - Points will be awarded for appropriate use of DTD element types (empty, container, and data).
  - Points will be awarded for the appropriate use of attributes.
  - Points will be awarded for the correct use of namespaces.

### Section 4: Transformation
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshots of the XSL/T file that transforms the XML data into an XHTML file.
  - Points will be awarded for correct use of XSL/T commands.
 
**Navigation**: With every page, a button to return to the home page is a must! Even when displaying XML content.

- XLM Content MUST BE IN A TABLE, or we lose marks.
  
**Display**: Screen flexibility should be scalable and work on most resolutions (Android use is optional).


> **Note**: These requirements are **mandatory** to achieve a high grade. Active participation from everyone is essential for a balanced contribution to the project.

## Storyboard

### Home Page
(TBI)

### Store Page

![Store Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346249b7-f46f-4e01-a1f6-18ed1e6a8209)

- The store page will display books sorted by genre in a horizontal scrollable row. 
- Hovering over a book will reveal an "Add to Cart" button.

### Cart Pop-up Menu

![Cart Pop-up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0339a7e2-0d51-426a-a014-d7a115192888)

- When a book is added to the cart, a pop-up will appear with a "Proceed to Checkout" button to redirect to the checkout page.
- Users can also close the pop-up and continue browsing the catalogue.

## Contribution

Each member will be required to earn a certain number of points to ensure an even contribution. This system helps track team progress, identify potential issues early, and avoid last-minute problems.

#### **Note**: Anything beyond the mandatory contributions will not count towards my (group leader's) points, as this could result in biased judgment. These contributions are only for group members to keep the project engaging and productive.

### Points Breakdown

- **+15** – HTML Page (M)
- **+5** – Front-end Design (M)
- **+5** – Validating HTML Page (M)
- **+3** – Validating Others' Work (O)
- **+3** – Input on Structure, Design, or Template Creation (O)
  - Points for input will only be awarded when all group members agree and the input is incorporated into the final product.

This is the initial plan, and suggestions from team members will be considered to enhance the contribution list.

## How to Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MukAHuss/CST1340-HTML.git

```

```bash
cd CST1340-HTML
```

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## How to run the website locally 

Since this file contains XML content styled using XSL, most modern browsers cannot view those pages. You will have to run the website in a browser that supports XML preview, such as Microsoft Edge or Firefox. If that still does not work, you can use Python to start a local server. 

In the command prompt terminal, cd into the directory of the website and use the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

You can change the port to whatever port is available on your system; 8000 is a common port most systems have already open.

After you start the server, use the following address to view the webpage on the local server: http.localhost:8000/index-m.html
